1. Quick Start Guide
====================
This chapter will guide you to quickly get started with the ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 development board.

You need to prepare the following tools:

- ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47 development board
- Type-C data cable x1
- Memory card x1
- Card reader x1

After receiving the product, you can use the included type-C cable to power on by inserting it into the ESP32-C6 module's type-C port. Normally, the product will automatically light up and display the Onboard Info interface as shown below.
